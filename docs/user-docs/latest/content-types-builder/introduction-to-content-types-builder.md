# Introduction to the Content-Types Builder

The Content-Types Builder is a core plugin of Strapi. It is a feature that is always activated by default and cannot be deleted. It is however only accessible when the application is in a development environment.

Administrators can access the Content-Types Builder from _Plugins > Content-Types Builder_ in the main navigation of the admin panel. From there, it is possible to create and manage content-types, including collection types, single types and components.

The Content-Types Builder contains 2 main parts: the navigation and the edition and configuration interface.

The navigation of the Content-Types Builder is divided into 3 categories:

- Collection type
- Single type 
- Components

Each category of the Content-Types Builder navigation lists all its related available same-named entries. From each category, it is possible to access the entry and edit it, or create a new one.
