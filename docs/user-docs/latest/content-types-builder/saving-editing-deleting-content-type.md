# Saving and deleting content types

Content types or components must be saved to be available in the Content Manager after creation, or updated after later modifications. Saving a content type or component is however only possible if at least one field has been added and configured: content types and components cannont be saved if they are empty.

To save a content type or a component with the Content-Types Builder, click on the **Save** button in the top right corner of the edition interface of your chosen content type or component.

## Deleting a content type

Content types and components can be deleted through the Content-Types Builder. Deleting a content type automatically deletes all entries from the Content Manager that were based on that content type. The same goes for the deletion of a component, which is automatically deleted from every content type or entry where it was used.

To delete a content type or component:

1. In the Content-Types Builder navigation, click on the name of the content type or component to delete.
2. In the edition interface of the chosen content type or component, click on the edit button <Fa-PencilAlt /> on the right side of the content type's or component's name.
3. In the edition window, click on the **Delete** button.
4. In the confirmation window, confirm the deletion.
